   To compile our study sample, we chose to begin with a bottom-up approach. We started with an open definition of data journalism by examining which productions (i.e. projects), aside from traditional journalistic articles, are classified as data journalism by relevant actors. We identified outlets that produce data journalism projects that fall within the broad purview of our study, which is interactive statistical data visualization projects on digital platforms. The chosen outlets include the websites of five major print publications (dailies and magazines) and the country’s French-language public radio and television broadcaster, ICI Radio-Canada (RC). Individual projects, such as those posted on blogs, were not included in this study. Projects were selected if they were classified under relevant content categories on the websites – such as the ‘Interactive’ section in The Gazette, or clickable keywords at the end of articles – or if they displayed combined characteristics that distinguish them from traditional articles (i.e. containing statistical data visualization and are created with technology only available in newsrooms since the turn of the millennium such as interactive maps). Where productions were not grouped into relevant categories, we conducted additional research, in the form of contacting the involved actors.

    Data journalism actors program algorithms and, more specifically, scripts, to collect data from a government site or image file. Although this use of algorithms is more difficult to identify (because this operation is rarely mentioned in the project’s description), we were able to detect that at least 23 per cent of the projects involved the use of a script to collect data. Following the benchmarks in Lev Manovich’s views on experimental videogame and web documentaries, we investigated the efforts to improve navigation and narration in the sampled projects. We noted that the programming efforts were concentrated on the creation and exploitation of databases, and not so much focus was put on navigation techniques and construction of narrative elements. Around 19 per cent of the study sample presents navigation efforts and 20 per cent contains elements of narration. Only 3 per cent presents both.

    Therefore, a development of computer and statistics skills among journalists participating in data journalism was not observed. We were able to confirm the hypothesis that a new kind of professionals had arrived in the province’s newsrooms, with a handful of actors with atypical professional profiles being responsible for the large majority of data journalism projects. We also found that data journalism in Quebec seems to have benefited from the development of new open source tools, with 72 per cent of the studied projects involving the use of such tools. But, by and large, journalists do not seem to engage deeply with this development.
