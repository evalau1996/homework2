<p>To compile our study sample, we chose to begin with a bottom-up approach. We started with an open definition of data journalism by examining which productions (i.e. projects), aside from traditional journalistic articles, are classified as data journalism by relevant actors. We identified outlets that produce data journalism projects that fall within the broad purview of our study, which is interactive statistical data visualization projects on digital platforms. The chosen outlets include the websites of five major print publications (dailies and magazines) and the country’s French-language public radio and television broadcaster, ICI Radio-Canada (RC). Individual projects, such as those posted on blogs, were not included in this study. Projects were selected if they were classified under relevant content categories on the websites – such as the ‘Interactive’ section in The Gazette, or clickable keywords at the end of articles – or if they displayed combined characteristics that distinguish them from traditional articles (i.e. containing statistical data visualization and are created with technology only available in newsrooms since the turn of the millennium such as interactive maps). Where productions were not grouped into relevant categories, we conducted additional research, in the form of contacting the involved actors.</p>
